Claude Session for 2025-8-8
  Claude: Please read the rules below and then try to complete all the session tasks.

  Session Rules:
    1. Do not install anything of anykind on the host machine. Only update Docker Images and Containers for new software.
    2. Do not change any files outside of the shepherd/app-repo git repository without asking first
    3. Do not change any Docker images that are unrelated to the DreamShepherd docker files
    4. Read the tasks below and complete them. Use the "Checks" beneath each task to determine if the task is complete. If a check fails to pass, try to determine why and start the task over again.

  Session Tasks
    1. Create a report file called "session-2025-8-8-report"
    2. Use docker with the compose file in app-repo and start the three services locally
      -Check: Did the services start?
      -Check: Can you use curl to get a successful response from the health endpoint of the express server running the shepherd-svc container?
      -Check: Can you request the homepage of Shepherd's React application and get a response from the Vite server running in the shepherd-ui container?
      -Check: Can you run "docker exec shepherd-db mongosh" and access the database?
      -Check: Can you update the files in app-repo/ui/src and make changes to the shepherd-ui service because Vite hot-reloads when code changes are made on the shared volume?
      -Check: Can you update the files in app-repo/svc/ and make changes to the shepherd-svc service because the Express server reloads when code changes are made on the shared volume?
      -Report: Update the report with the results of task 1. Try to use less than 100 words.
    3. Update the Dockerfile for the shepherd ui at app-repo/ui/local.Dockerfile to include Playwright, Jest and jsdom. Build the Dockerfile with "-t shepherd-ui" and shut down the compose services and restart them with the new shepherd-ui image.
      -Check: Was local.Dockerfile updated correctly to include the new dependencies?
      -Check: Did the new Docker image build successfully?
      -Check: Did compose successfully shut down?
      -Check: Did compose successfully restart the services, using the new shepherd-ui image for the UI container?
      -Check: Are you able to run "docker exec shepherd-ui <command>" for jest, jsdom and Playwright commands?a
      -Report: Update the report with the results of task 2. Try to use less than 100 words.
    4. Run app-repo/svc/test-integration.sh and fix and tests that fail to pass
      -Check: Did all of the tests pass?
      -Check: If any tests failed to pass, what was the first test that failed to pass? Did it fail because the test is poorly designed or because the associated code is broken?
      -Report: Update the report with the results of task 3. Try to use less than 100 words.
    5. Design and implement integration tests using Playwright to test app-repo/ui/src/DreamShepherd.jsx and app-repo/ui/src/Intro.jsx. Run the tests.
      -Check: Do the tests cover the functionality of DreamShepherd.jsx and Intro.jsx?
      -Check: Do the tests run?
      -Check: What is the first test that doesn't pass? Why didn't it pass?
      -Report: Update the report with the results of task 3. Try to use less than 100 words.
