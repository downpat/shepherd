# Shepherd Development Sessions

## Session 2025-07-17

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Define architectural approach for Shepherd application

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Architecture Choice**: Adopted "Implied Clean Architecture" approach
   - Follows "Dependencies Point Inward" principle
   - Avoids premature complexity while maintaining architectural benefits
   - Allows organic growth without TypeScript commitment

2. **Domain Model Established**:
   - Dream → Goals → Plans → Tasks → Habits progression
   - Goals convert to Accomplishments when completed
   - Focus on identity transformation through achievements

3. **Project Structure Defined**:
   - Phase 1: `components/`, `domain/`, `services/` structure
   - Evolution path planned for growing complexity
   - Clear dependency rules established

### Architectural Impact
- **Foundation Set**: Core architectural principles now guide all future development
- **Flexibility Maintained**: Can evolve to full Clean Architecture or TypeScript as needed
- **Dependency Direction**: Prevents common architectural problems as project scales

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 2 JSX files (very early stage)
- **Phase**: 1 (Basic setup with architectural guidelines)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Implied Clean Architecture established

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Create `src/domain/` directory structure
   - Implement core entities (Dream, Goal, etc.) as JavaScript objects/functions
   - Establish basic business logic functions

2. **Maturity Considerations**:
   - **Stay in Phase 1** until more components are needed
   - **Consider TypeScript** when domain validation becomes complex
   - **Add state management** when props drilling becomes painful

3. **Architecture Evolution Triggers to Watch For**:
   - More than 10 components → Consider Phase 2 structure
   - Complex business rules → Consider TypeScript
   - Multiple data sources → Consider Repository pattern

### Files Modified This Session
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added architecture guidelines, domain model, session management rules
- `ClaudeSession.md`: Created session tracking system

### Action Items for Next Session
- [x] Create domain structure with core entities
- [x] Implement basic Dream and Goal JavaScript objects
- [x] Plan component structure following dependency rules

## Session 2025-07-18

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Implement vertical slice of architecture with Dream entity

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Domain Layer Implementation**: 
   - Created `Dream.js` with complete entity model (id, slug, title, vision, goals, roleModels)
   - Implemented factory functions, validation, and business logic
   - Added `RoleModel.js` supporting entity with resources and accomplishments

2. **Service Layer Creation**:
   - Built `DreamService.js` as singleton service managing Dream operations
   - Implemented CRUD operations with validation and error handling
   - Added event system for UI reactivity and future state management
   - Included search, export/import capabilities for future expansion

3. **UI Layer Component**:
   - Created `DreamEditor.jsx` React component for creating/editing dreams
   - Integrated form validation, state management, and error handling
   - Connected directly to domain layer through service layer
   - Follows existing design patterns and styling from App.jsx

### Architectural Impact
- **Vertical Slice Complete**: Full architecture stack implemented for Dreams
- **Dependency Flow Proven**: UI → Service → Domain pattern established
- **Template for Future Entities**: Pattern can be replicated for Goals, Plans, Tasks
- **Clean Architecture Validated**: Three-layer approach working effectively

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 6 files (significant growth from 2 JSX files)
- **Phase**: 1 (Established three-layer architecture)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture layers functional and tested

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Slug Generation**: Dreams have both UUID and human-readable slugs for URLs
2. **Markdown Support**: Vision field supports Markdown (WYSIWYG to be added later)
3. **In-Memory Storage**: Service layer uses Map for now, with persistence hooks ready
4. **Event System**: Service layer includes listener pattern for UI reactivity

### Files Created This Session
- `src/domain/Dream.js`: Core Dream entity with business logic
- `src/domain/RoleModel.js`: Supporting entity for inspiration/guidance
- `src/services/DreamService.js`: Service layer for Dream operations
- `src/components/DreamEditor.jsx`: React component for Dream creation/editing

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Immediate Integration**:
   - Connect DreamEditor to existing App.jsx user input flow
   - Add Dream viewing/listing components
   - Implement basic navigation between Dream states

2. **Architecture Expansion**:
   - Apply same vertical slice pattern to Goals entity
   - Consider adding simple routing for Dream management
   - Plan Goal → Plan → Task entity relationships

3. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Add proper Markdown WYSIWYG editor for vision field
   - Implement data persistence (localStorage first, then external)
   - Add role model management within Dream editor

## Session 2025-07-18 (Continued)

### Session Summary Part 2
**Objective**: Implement React Router and transition to full-page Dream experience

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **React Router Integration**:
   - Installed `react-router-dom` dependency
   - Renamed `App.jsx` to `Intro.jsx` for better semantic naming
   - Created new `DreamShepherd.jsx` as main router component (better than generic "App")
   - Updated `main.jsx` to use `DreamShepherd` as root component

2. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Fixed jarring "Create Dream" button placement in intro panel
   - Implemented column layout with user text on left, button on right
   - Removed modal overlay for DreamEditor (preparing for full-page experience)
   - Button now floats gracefully without blocking user input

3. **Routing Architecture**:
   - Set up routes: `/` for Intro, `/dream/new` for creation, `/dream/:slug` for editing
   - Navigation using `useNavigate` hook to pass title state between components
   - Prepared foundation for full-page Dream editing experience

### Architectural Evolution
- **Major Transition**: From modal-based to route-based navigation
- **Naming Improvement**: `DreamShepherd.jsx` reflects project identity better than `App.jsx`
- **User Experience**: Dreams now treated as first-class entities deserving full pages
- **Route Structure**: Clean URL patterns supporting future Dream management features

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 7 files (added routing layer)
- **Phase**: 1+ (Enhanced with routing and improved UX)
- **Tech Stack**: React + React Router + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + React Router for navigation

### Files Modified/Created This Session Part 2
- **Renamed**: `App.jsx` → `Intro.jsx`
- **Created**: `DreamShepherd.jsx` (main router component)
- **Modified**: `main.jsx` (updated to use DreamShepherd)
- **Modified**: `Intro.jsx` (removed modal, added navigation)
- **Added**: `react-router-dom` to dependencies

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Architecture Review Session**:
   - Review app growth and architectural management strategies

   - Plan evolution path for upcoming features

2. **DreamsDashboard Implementation**:
   - Create `DreamsDashboard.jsx` component for viewing all dreams
   - Add route `/dreams` for dashboard access
   - Implement dream listing with "Create New Dream" option
   - Connect save flow to redirect to dashboard after dream creation

3. **User Flow Enhancement**:
   - Complete the cycle: Intro → Create Dream → Save → Dreams Dashboard
   - Add navigation between dashboard and individual dreams
   - Consider breadcrumb navigation for user orientation

4. **Technical Debt & Improvements**:
   - Update DreamEditor to be true full-page component (remove modal styling)
   - Add loading states and error handling for navigation
   - Consider adding dream preview/summary cards in dashboard

## Session 2025-07-19

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Simplify routing and establish UX rules for existing users

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Routing Simplification**:
   - Removed `/dream/new` route in favor of unified `/dream/:slug` pattern
   - Dreams are now created immediately when user clicks "Create Dream" with their title
   - All dream editing uses consistent slug-based URLs that can be shared
   - Updated DreamEditor to load dreams by slug from URL params

2. **UX Rules Established**:
   - **Intro Page Behavior**: Intro should only run for new users who haven't seen it before
   - **Navigation for Existing Users**: Users with dreams should navigate to Dreams Dashboard, not Intro
   - **Error Handling**: Failed operations redirect to Dreams Dashboard for users with dreams
   - **Dreams Dashboard as Home**: For existing users, `/dreams` becomes their primary landing page

3. **Service Layer Enhancement**:
   - Leveraged existing `getDreamBySlug` method for URL-based dream loading
   - Updated DreamEditor to work as standalone route component
   - Added loading states for dream fetching

### Architectural Impact
- **Simplified Routing**: Single pattern `/dream/:slug` for all dream editing
- **User-Centric Navigation**: Different home pages based on user state (new vs existing)
- **Shareable URLs**: Dream URLs are now human-readable and shareable
- **State Management**: Dreams created immediately upon user intent, not on save

### UX Decision: Empty Dreams Handling
**Future Consideration**: Need to handle completely empty dreams in UX flow
- Current: Dreams created with title from Intro, then user fills vision
- Future: Consider allowing truly empty dreams or different creation patterns
- Note: This routing pattern supports both current and future empty dream scenarios

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 7 files (routing simplified, no new files)
- **Phase**: 1+ (Enhanced routing with user-centric navigation)
- **Tech Stack**: React + React Router + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + simplified routing patterns

### Files Modified This Session
- `DreamShepherd.jsx`: Removed `/dream/new` route
- `Intro.jsx`: Added dream creation before navigation, imports domain/service layers
- `DreamEditor.jsx`: Converted to route component with slug-based loading and Dreams Dashboard navigation

### Next Session Recommendations
**Priority 1: Complete Dreamer Flow**
1. **Create DreamsDashboard Component**: 
   - Route: `/dreams` for listing all dreams
   - "Create New Dream" functionality
   - Links to individual dreams via slug
   - Becomes home page for existing users

2. **Implement User State Detection**:
   - Check if user has dreams on app load
   - Route new users to Intro, existing users to Dreams Dashboard
   - Update root route `/` logic accordingly

**Priority 2: Architecture Expansion**
3. **Goals Entity Implementation**: Apply same vertical slice pattern to Goals
4. **User Flow Completion**: Intro → Create Dream → Edit Dream → Dreams Dashboard cycle

**Keep in Mind**: DreamsDashboard, complete Dreamer flow, Goals entity expansion

## Session 2025-07-19 (Continued)

### Session Summary Part 2
**Objective**: Establish Dreams hierarchy of importance and UX philosophy

**Key Philosophical Decisions**:
1. **Dreams are Sacred, Not Disposable**:
   - Dreams require highest level of intention to create
   - Dreamers should have "less than a handful" of dreams (not thousands)
   - Dream death causes real disappointment - UX must reflect this weight
   - Dreams should be comprehensive and deeply descriptive

2. **Hierarchy of Disposability Established**:
   ```
   Dreams (Sacred) → Goals (Moderate) → Plans (Disposable) → Tasks (Highly Disposable)
   ```
   - Tasks can be created/deleted flippantly - "shrugged off as soon as possible"
   - Dreams require contemplative state of mind and careful consideration
   - UI weight must match entity importance

3. **Anti-Task Manager Philosophy**:
   - DreamShepherd is NOT a productivity tool - it's a life transformation tool
   - Dreams deserve full-page experiences, never small lists or modals
   - Contemplative design should encourage thoughtful interaction
   - Quality over quantity for Dreams (opposite of typical task apps)

4. **Dreamer Terminology Established**:
   - Always "Dreamers", never "users"
   - Reflects aspirational, intentional nature of application

### UX Implications for Future Development:
- **DreamsDashboard**: Must honor Dreams' sacred nature, not treat them as list items
- **Dream Creation**: Should feel weighty, requiring deliberate decision to engage
- **Navigation**: Dreams are destinations, not quick actions
- **Interaction Design**: Slow, intentional flows over fast, efficient ones

### Architecture Impact:
- Reinforces full-page routing decisions (no modals for Dreams)
- Validates Clean Architecture approach (Dreams as domain center)
- Guides future Goals/Plans/Tasks UI - different weight for different entities

### Rules Added to CLAUDE.md:
- Entity hierarchy by importance and disposability
- UX weight and intention guidelines
- Anti-productivity mindset principles
- Dreamer terminology requirements
- Code organization rules (group by relationship, then alphabetize)

### Technical Accomplishments:
- Fixed updateSingleDream method to properly use domain layer updateDream function
- Established vim configuration for JavaScript development (2-space tabs, syntax highlighting)
- Completed line length cleanup across codebase (79-character standard)
- Added semantic CSS classes for Dream-specific UI elements

### Session End - Next Priority Tasks:
**CRITICAL FOR NEXT SESSION:**

1. **DreamsDashboard Implementation** (High Priority):
   - Create `/dreams` route component for viewing all Dreams
   - Must honor Dreams' sacred nature - NOT simple list items
   - Use substantial visual presence for each Dream (cards/tiles)
   - Include "Create New Dream" functionality
   - Becomes home page for existing Dreamers

2. **Complete Dreamer Flow** (High Priority):
   - Implement user state detection (new vs existing Dreamers)
   - Route new Dreamers to Intro, existing to DreamsDashboard
   - Complete cycle: Intro → Create Dream → Edit Dream → Save → DreamsDashboard
   - Test full navigation flow

3. **Goals Entity Architecture** (Medium Priority):
   - Apply same vertical slice pattern (Domain → Service → UI)
   - Create Goals domain entity with business logic
   - Implement GoalsService following DreamService pattern
   - Design Goals UI components (respecting hierarchy: less sacred than Dreams)
   - Integrate Goals into Dream entity relationships

4. **Future Considerations**:
   - Add proper error handling UI throughout application
   - Implement data persistence (localStorage → external API)
   - Consider offline sync capabilities
   - Add style guide and linter configuration

**Architecture Status**: Clean Architecture proven effective, ready for horizontal expansion to Goals entity

**Philosophy Established**: Dreams are sacred, Goals are tactical, Plans are disposable, Tasks are highly disposable
