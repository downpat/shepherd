# Shepherd Development Sessions

## Session 2025-07-17

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Define architectural approach for Shepherd application

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Architecture Choice**: Adopted "Implied Clean Architecture" approach
   - Follows "Dependencies Point Inward" principle
   - Avoids premature complexity while maintaining architectural benefits
   - Allows organic growth without TypeScript commitment

2. **Domain Model Established**:
   - Dream → Goals → Plans → Tasks → Habits progression
   - Goals convert to Accomplishments when completed
   - Focus on identity transformation through achievements

3. **Project Structure Defined**:
   - Phase 1: `components/`, `domain/`, `services/` structure
   - Evolution path planned for growing complexity
   - Clear dependency rules established

### Architectural Impact
- **Foundation Set**: Core architectural principles now guide all future development
- **Flexibility Maintained**: Can evolve to full Clean Architecture or TypeScript as needed
- **Dependency Direction**: Prevents common architectural problems as project scales

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 2 JSX files (very early stage)
- **Phase**: 1 (Basic setup with architectural guidelines)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Implied Clean Architecture established

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Create `src/domain/` directory structure
   - Implement core entities (Dream, Goal, etc.) as JavaScript objects/functions
   - Establish basic business logic functions

2. **Maturity Considerations**:
   - **Stay in Phase 1** until more components are needed
   - **Consider TypeScript** when domain validation becomes complex
   - **Add state management** when props drilling becomes painful

3. **Architecture Evolution Triggers to Watch For**:
   - More than 10 components → Consider Phase 2 structure
   - Complex business rules → Consider TypeScript
   - Multiple data sources → Consider Repository pattern

### Files Modified This Session
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added architecture guidelines, domain model, session management rules
- `ClaudeSession.md`: Created session tracking system

### Action Items for Next Session
- [ ] Create domain structure with core entities
- [ ] Implement basic Dream and Goal JavaScript objects
- [ ] Plan component structure following dependency rules
