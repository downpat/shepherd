# Shepherd Development Sessions

## Session 2025-07-17

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Define architectural approach for Shepherd application

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Architecture Choice**: Adopted "Implied Clean Architecture" approach
   - Follows "Dependencies Point Inward" principle
   - Avoids premature complexity while maintaining architectural benefits
   - Allows organic growth without TypeScript commitment

2. **Domain Model Established**:
   - Dream → Goals → Plans → Tasks → Habits progression
   - Goals convert to Accomplishments when completed
   - Focus on identity transformation through achievements

3. **Project Structure Defined**:
   - Phase 1: `components/`, `domain/`, `services/` structure
   - Evolution path planned for growing complexity
   - Clear dependency rules established

### Architectural Impact
- **Foundation Set**: Core architectural principles now guide all future development
- **Flexibility Maintained**: Can evolve to full Clean Architecture or TypeScript as needed
- **Dependency Direction**: Prevents common architectural problems as project scales

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 2 JSX files (very early stage)
- **Phase**: 1 (Basic setup with architectural guidelines)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Implied Clean Architecture established

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Create `src/domain/` directory structure
   - Implement core entities (Dream, Goal, etc.) as JavaScript objects/functions
   - Establish basic business logic functions

2. **Maturity Considerations**:
   - **Stay in Phase 1** until more components are needed
   - **Consider TypeScript** when domain validation becomes complex
   - **Add state management** when props drilling becomes painful

3. **Architecture Evolution Triggers to Watch For**:
   - More than 10 components → Consider Phase 2 structure
   - Complex business rules → Consider TypeScript
   - Multiple data sources → Consider Repository pattern

### Files Modified This Session
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added architecture guidelines, domain model, session management rules
- `ClaudeSession.md`: Created session tracking system

### Action Items for Next Session
- [x] Create domain structure with core entities
- [x] Implement basic Dream and Goal JavaScript objects
- [x] Plan component structure following dependency rules

## Session 2025-07-18

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Implement vertical slice of architecture with Dream entity

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Domain Layer Implementation**: 
   - Created `Dream.js` with complete entity model (id, slug, title, vision, goals, roleModels)
   - Implemented factory functions, validation, and business logic
   - Added `RoleModel.js` supporting entity with resources and accomplishments

2. **Service Layer Creation**:
   - Built `DreamService.js` as singleton service managing Dream operations
   - Implemented CRUD operations with validation and error handling
   - Added event system for UI reactivity and future state management
   - Included search, export/import capabilities for future expansion

3. **UI Layer Component**:
   - Created `DreamEditor.jsx` React component for creating/editing dreams
   - Integrated form validation, state management, and error handling
   - Connected directly to domain layer through service layer
   - Follows existing design patterns and styling from App.jsx

### Architectural Impact
- **Vertical Slice Complete**: Full architecture stack implemented for Dreams
- **Dependency Flow Proven**: UI → Service → Domain pattern established
- **Template for Future Entities**: Pattern can be replicated for Goals, Plans, Tasks
- **Clean Architecture Validated**: Three-layer approach working effectively

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 6 files (significant growth from 2 JSX files)
- **Phase**: 1 (Established three-layer architecture)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture layers functional and tested

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Slug Generation**: Dreams have both UUID and human-readable slugs for URLs
2. **Markdown Support**: Vision field supports Markdown (WYSIWYG to be added later)
3. **In-Memory Storage**: Service layer uses Map for now, with persistence hooks ready
4. **Event System**: Service layer includes listener pattern for UI reactivity

### Files Created This Session
- `src/domain/Dream.js`: Core Dream entity with business logic
- `src/domain/RoleModel.js`: Supporting entity for inspiration/guidance
- `src/services/DreamService.js`: Service layer for Dream operations
- `src/components/DreamEditor.jsx`: React component for Dream creation/editing

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Immediate Integration**:
   - Connect DreamEditor to existing App.jsx user input flow
   - Add Dream viewing/listing components
   - Implement basic navigation between Dream states

2. **Architecture Expansion**:
   - Apply same vertical slice pattern to Goals entity
   - Consider adding simple routing for Dream management
   - Plan Goal → Plan → Task entity relationships

3. **Enhancement Opportunities**:
   - Add proper Markdown WYSIWYG editor for vision field
   - Implement data persistence (localStorage first, then external)
   - Add role model management within Dream editor

## Session 2025-07-18 (Continued)

### Session Summary Part 2
**Objective**: Implement React Router and transition to full-page Dream experience

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **React Router Integration**:
   - Installed `react-router-dom` dependency
   - Renamed `App.jsx` to `Intro.jsx` for better semantic naming
   - Created new `DreamShepherd.jsx` as main router component (better than generic "App")
   - Updated `main.jsx` to use `DreamShepherd` as root component

2. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Fixed jarring "Create Dream" button placement in intro panel
   - Implemented column layout with user text on left, button on right
   - Removed modal overlay for DreamEditor (preparing for full-page experience)
   - Button now floats gracefully without blocking user input

3. **Routing Architecture**:
   - Set up routes: `/` for Intro, `/dream/new` for creation, `/dream/:slug` for editing
   - Navigation using `useNavigate` hook to pass title state between components
   - Prepared foundation for full-page Dream editing experience

### Architectural Evolution
- **Major Transition**: From modal-based to route-based navigation
- **Naming Improvement**: `DreamShepherd.jsx` reflects project identity better than `App.jsx`
- **User Experience**: Dreams now treated as first-class entities deserving full pages
- **Route Structure**: Clean URL patterns supporting future Dream management features

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 7 files (added routing layer)
- **Phase**: 1+ (Enhanced with routing and improved UX)
- **Tech Stack**: React + React Router + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + React Router for navigation

### Files Modified/Created This Session Part 2
- **Renamed**: `App.jsx` → `Intro.jsx`
- **Created**: `DreamShepherd.jsx` (main router component)
- **Modified**: `main.jsx` (updated to use DreamShepherd)
- **Modified**: `Intro.jsx` (removed modal, added navigation)
- **Added**: `react-router-dom` to dependencies

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Architecture Review Session**:
   - Review app growth and architectural management strategies
   - Assess Clean Architecture effectiveness at current scale
   - Plan evolution path for upcoming features

2. **DreamsDashboard Implementation**:
   - Create `DreamsDashboard.jsx` component for viewing all dreams
   - Add route `/dreams` for dashboard access
   - Implement dream listing with "Create New Dream" option
   - Connect save flow to redirect to dashboard after dream creation

3. **User Flow Enhancement**:
   - Complete the cycle: Intro → Create Dream → Save → Dreams Dashboard
   - Add navigation between dashboard and individual dreams
   - Consider breadcrumb navigation for user orientation

4. **Technical Debt & Improvements**:
   - Update DreamEditor to be true full-page component (remove modal styling)
   - Add loading states and error handling for navigation
   - Consider adding dream preview/summary cards in dashboard
