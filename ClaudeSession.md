# Shepherd Development Sessions

## Session 2025-07-17

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Define architectural approach for Shepherd application

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Architecture Choice**: Adopted "Implied Clean Architecture" approach
   - Follows "Dependencies Point Inward" principle
   - Avoids premature complexity while maintaining architectural benefits
   - Allows organic growth without TypeScript commitment

2. **Domain Model Established**:
   - Dream → Goals → Plans → Tasks → Habits progression
   - Goals convert to Accomplishments when completed
   - Focus on identity transformation through achievements

3. **Project Structure Defined**:
   - Phase 1: `components/`, `domain/`, `services/` structure
   - Evolution path planned for growing complexity
   - Clear dependency rules established

### Architectural Impact
- **Foundation Set**: Core architectural principles now guide all future development
- **Flexibility Maintained**: Can evolve to full Clean Architecture or TypeScript as needed
- **Dependency Direction**: Prevents common architectural problems as project scales

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 2 JSX files (very early stage)
- **Phase**: 1 (Basic setup with architectural guidelines)
- **Tech Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Implied Clean Architecture established

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Immediate Next Steps**:
   - Create `src/domain/` directory structure
   - Implement core entities (Dream, Goal, etc.) as JavaScript objects/functions
   - Establish basic business logic functions

2. **Maturity Considerations**:
   - **Stay in Phase 1** until more components are needed
   - **Consider TypeScript** when domain validation becomes complex
   - **Add state management** when props drilling becomes painful

3. **Architecture Evolution Triggers to Watch For**:
   - More than 10 components → Consider Phase 2 structure
   - Complex business rules → Consider TypeScript
   - Multiple data sources → Consider Repository pattern

## Session 2025-07-18 (Continued)

### Session Summary Part 2
**Objective**: Implement React Router and transition to full-page Dream experience

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **React Router Integration**:
   - Installed `react-router-dom` dependency
   - Renamed `App.jsx` to `Intro.jsx` for better semantic naming
   - Created new `DreamShepherd.jsx` as main router component (better than generic "App")
   - Updated `main.jsx` to use `DreamShepherd` as root component

2. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Fixed jarring "Create Dream" button placement in intro panel
   - Implemented column layout with user text on left, button on right
   - Removed modal overlay for DreamEditor (preparing for full-page experience)
   - Button now floats gracefully without blocking user input

3. **Routing Architecture**:
   - Set up routes: `/` for Intro, `/dream/new` for creation, `/dream/:slug` for editing
   - Navigation using `useNavigate` hook to pass title state between components
   - Prepared foundation for full-page Dream editing experience

### Architectural Evolution
- **Major Transition**: From modal-based to route-based navigation
- **Naming Improvement**: `DreamShepherd.jsx` reflects project identity better than `App.jsx`
- **User Experience**: Dreams now treated as first-class entities deserving full pages
- **Route Structure**: Clean URL patterns supporting future Dream management features

### Current Project State

## Session 2025-07-19

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Simplify routing and establish UX rules for existing users

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Routing Simplification**:
   - Removed `/dream/new` route in favor of unified `/dream/:slug` pattern
   - Dreams are now created immediately when user clicks "Create Dream" with their title
   - All dream editing uses consistent slug-based URLs that can be shared
   - Updated DreamEditor to load dreams by slug from URL params

2. **UX Rules Established**:
   - **Intro Page Behavior**: Intro should only run for new users who haven't seen it before
   - **Navigation for Existing Users**: Users with dreams should navigate to Dreams Dashboard, not Intro
   - **Error Handling**: Failed operations redirect to Dreams Dashboard for users with dreams
   - **Dreams Dashboard as Home**: For existing users, `/dreams` becomes their primary landing page

3. **Service Layer Enhancement**:
   - Leveraged existing `getDreamBySlug` method for URL-based dream loading
   - Updated DreamEditor to work as standalone route component
   - Added loading states for dream fetching

### Architectural Impact
- **Simplified Routing**: Single pattern `/dream/:slug` for all dream editing
- **User-Centric Navigation**: Different home pages based on user state (new vs existing)
- **Shareable URLs**: Dream URLs are now human-readable and shareable
- **State Management**: Dreams created immediately upon user intent, not on save

### UX Decision: Empty Dreams Handling
**Future Consideration**: Need to handle completely empty dreams in UX flow
- Current: Dreams created with title from Intro, then user fills vision
- Future: Consider allowing truly empty dreams or different creation patterns
- Note: This routing pattern supports both current and future empty dream scenarios

### Current Project State
- **Size**: 7 files (routing simplified, no new files)
- **Phase**: 1+ (Enhanced routing with user-centric navigation)
- **Tech Stack**: React + React Router + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui + Framer Motion
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + simplified routing patterns

### Files Modified This Session
- `DreamShepherd.jsx`: Removed `/dream/new` route
- `Intro.jsx`: Added dream creation before navigation, imports domain/service layers
- `DreamEditor.jsx`: Converted to route component with slug-based loading and Dreams Dashboard navigation

### Next Session Recommendations
**Priority 1: Complete Dreamer Flow**
1. **Create DreamsDashboard Component**: 
   - Route: `/dreams` for listing all dreams
   - "Create New Dream" functionality
   - Links to individual dreams via slug
   - Becomes home page for existing users

2. **Implement User State Detection**:
   - Check if user has dreams on app load
   - Route new users to Intro, existing users to Dreams Dashboard
   - Update root route `/` logic accordingly

**Priority 2: Architecture Expansion**
3. **Goals Entity Implementation**: Apply same vertical slice pattern to Goals
4. **User Flow Completion**: Intro → Create Dream → Edit Dream → Dreams Dashboard cycle

**Keep in Mind**: DreamsDashboard, complete Dreamer flow, Goals entity expansion

## Session 2025-07-19 (Continued)

### Session Summary Part 2
**Objective**: Establish Dreams hierarchy of importance and UX philosophy

**Key Philosophical Decisions**:
1. **Dreams are Sacred, Not Disposable**:
   - Dreams require highest level of intention to create
   - Dreamers should have "less than a handful" of dreams (not thousands)
   - Dream death causes real disappointment - UX must reflect this weight
   - Dreams should be comprehensive and deeply descriptive

2. **Hierarchy of Disposability Established**:
   ```
   Dreams (Sacred) → Goals (Moderate) → Plans (Disposable) → Tasks (Highly Disposable)
   ```
   - Tasks can be created/deleted flippantly - "shrugged off as soon as possible"
   - Dreams require contemplative state of mind and careful consideration
   - UI weight must match entity importance

3. **Anti-Task Manager Philosophy**:
   - DreamShepherd is NOT a productivity tool - it's a life transformation tool
   - Dreams deserve full-page experiences, never small lists or modals
   - Contemplative design should encourage thoughtful interaction
   - Quality over quantity for Dreams (opposite of typical task apps)

4. **Dreamer Terminology Established**:
   - Always "Dreamers", never "users"
   - Reflects aspirational, intentional nature of application

### UX Implications for Future Development:
- **DreamsDashboard**: Must honor Dreams' sacred nature, not treat them as list items
- **Dream Creation**: Should feel weighty, requiring deliberate decision to engage
- **Navigation**: Dreams are destinations, not quick actions
- **Interaction Design**: Slow, intentional flows over fast, efficient ones

### Architecture Impact:
- Reinforces full-page routing decisions (no modals for Dreams)
- Validates Clean Architecture approach (Dreams as domain center)
- Guides future Goals/Plans/Tasks UI - different weight for different entities

### Rules Added to CLAUDE.md:
- Entity hierarchy by importance and disposability
- UX weight and intention guidelines
- Anti-productivity mindset principles
- Dreamer terminology requirements
- Code organization rules (group by relationship, then alphabetize)

### Technical Accomplishments:
- Fixed updateSingleDream method to properly use domain layer updateDream function
- Established vim configuration for JavaScript development (2-space tabs, syntax highlighting)
- Completed line length cleanup across codebase (79-character standard)
- Added semantic CSS classes for Dream-specific UI elements

### Session End - Next Priority Tasks:
**CRITICAL FOR NEXT SESSION:**

1. **DreamsDashboard Implementation** (High Priority):
   - Create `/dreams` route component for viewing all Dreams
   - Must honor Dreams' sacred nature - NOT simple list items
   - Use substantial visual presence for each Dream (cards/tiles)
   - Include "Create New Dream" functionality
   - Becomes home page for existing Dreamers

2. **Complete Dreamer Flow** (High Priority):
   - Implement user state detection (new vs existing Dreamers)
   - Route new Dreamers to Intro, existing to DreamsDashboard
   - Complete cycle: Intro → Create Dream → Edit Dream → Save → DreamsDashboard
   - Test full navigation flow

3. **Goals Entity Architecture** (Medium Priority):
   - Apply same vertical slice pattern (Domain → Service → UI)
   - Create Goals domain entity with business logic
   - Implement GoalsService following DreamService pattern
   - Design Goals UI components (respecting hierarchy: less sacred than Dreams)
   - Integrate Goals into Dream entity relationships

4. **Future Considerations**:
   - Add proper error handling UI throughout application
   - Implement data persistence (localStorage → external API)
   - Consider offline sync capabilities
   - Add style guide and linter configuration

**Architecture Status**: Clean Architecture proven effective, ready for horizontal expansion to Goals entity

**Philosophy Established**: Dreams are sacred, Goals are tactical, Plans are disposable, Tasks are highly disposable

## Session 2025-07-20

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Bug fix and prep for Goals/Plans implementation

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Fixed CSS bug: `resize-vertical` → `resize-y` in `ui/src/index.css:27`
- User began Goals/Plans architecture modeling (continuing next session)

### Next Session Priority
- Complete Goals and Plans domain modeling and implementation

## Session 2025-07-24

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Design entity models for Goals, Plans, Tasks, Sessions, and Habits

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Goals Entity Implementation** (SMART Framework):
   - Designed Goals with SMART framework: Specific (title/description), Measurable (target/magnitude), Attainable (confidence 1-10), Relevant (relevance field), Time-bound (timeHorizon/timeLimit)
   - Added 8 categories: Health, Fitness, Education, Professional, Social, Family, Money, Spiritual
   - Time horizons: short-term (day, <1yr), mid-term (month, <3yr), long-term (year, 5+yr)
   - Loosely coupled to Dreams via dreamIds array for future many-to-many support
   - Independent slugs not coupled to Dream slugs

2. **Plans Entity Implementation**:
   - Plans as daily workspace with one-to-one Goal relationship
   - Mission statement with versioning system (volumes/chapters tracking evolution)
   - Contains taskIds, sessionIds, habitIds arrays
   - Statistics tracking for progress metrics

3. **Tasks Entity Implementation**:
   - Simplified to essentials: title, scheduledDate, scheduledTime, status
   - Three statuses only: scheduled, completed, skipped
   - Integer IDs for autocomplete, collision-safe slugs (task-{id}-{title})
   - No descriptions, mission connections, completion timestamps, or rescheduling
   - Highly disposable design philosophy

4. **Sessions Entity Implementation**:
   - Prerequisites array (conditions like "quiet workspace", "not too tired")
   - Duration in minutes, mission connection description
   - Post-session reflection: sessionNotes (what happened) and sessionMood (how they felt)
   - Real-time UI capability noted for future implementation

5. **Habits Architecture** (Two-Entity System):
   - **HabitIdentity**: Earned badge with UUID, name chosen by Dreamer, source info
   - **HabitInstance**: Simple pairing of habitIdentityId + taskId
   - Eliminates duplication by reusing Task entity for scheduling

6. **Habit Promotion Algorithm Design**:
   - 30+ completions in 60 days makes Tasks/Sessions eligible for habit status
   - Algorithm: filter last 60 days → group by title → count completions → promote if ≥30
   - Applied to both Tasks and Sessions independently

### Architectural Impact
- **Entity Relationships Established**: Dream → Goal → Plan → Tasks/Sessions → Habits
- **Time Horizon Hierarchy**: Dreams (timeless) → Goals (SMART) → Plans (operational) → Tasks/Sessions (scheduled) → Habits (routine)
- **Identity System**: Habits as earned badges affecting Dreamer identity
- **Workspace Concept**: Plans as primary daily interaction point

### Current Project State
- **Entity Models**: 7 domain entities designed (Dream, Goal, Plan, Task, Session, HabitIdentity, HabitInstance)
- **Files Created**: Goal.js, Plan.js, Task.js, Session.js, HabitIdentity.js, HabitInstance.js
- **Phase**: 1+ (Expanded domain model with comprehensive entity architecture)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with full entity relationship system

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Field Naming**: `timeHorizon` chosen over "timeLength" for Goals
2. **Task Simplification**: Removed complexity, kept only essential fields
3. **Session Reflection**: Added sessionNotes and sessionMood for post-completion
4. **Habit Decomposition**: Split into Identity (earned badge) and Instance (scheduling)
5. **Loose Coupling**: Goals support future many-to-many with Dreams
6. **Integer IDs**: Tasks use simple integers for autocomplete functionality

### Files Created/Modified This Session

   - Current issue: DreamService throwing exceptions caused debug mode navigation bugs

2. **Shepherd UI Design** (High Priority):
   - Create Shepherd UI element as sole source of guidance and instruction
   - Design contextual guidance system with Shepherd personality
   - Implement gentle desktop transition messaging through Shepherd interface
   - Replace any remaining helper text with Shepherd interactions

3. **Complete Application Flow**:
   - Implement DreamsDashboard for viewing all Dreams
   - Complete Dreamer journey: Intro → Dreams → Goals → Plans
   - Test full application flow on multiple devices

### Technical Debt Identified
- **Over-engineered Error Handling**: Too many defensive code paths causing bugs and complexity
- **Service Layer Exceptions**: DreamService throwing exceptions instead of returning null/empty results
- **Error Boundary Strategy**: Need consistent approach to error handling across application

### Development Workflow Established
- **Mobile Testing**: Chrome remote debugging setup for real-time mobile development
- **Debug Mode**: Direct URL navigation for rapid iteration without intro flow
- **Responsive Development**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancement

**Key Insight**: Sometimes defensive programming and extensive error checking creates more problems than it solves. Simpler, more predictable code paths often lead to fewer bugs and easier debugging.

## Session 2025-07-29

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Update CLAUDE.md with backend architecture and discuss infrastructure orchestration strategy

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Architecture Documentation Update**:
   - Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect new backend services from previous session
   - Added Node.js/Express API service (Port 3001) and MongoDB database (Port 27017) to tech stack
   - Updated repository structure to include `/svc/` directory with backend files
   - Enhanced Docker setup documentation for multi-service architecture
   - Updated current status to reflect full-stack architecture with 20+ files

2. **Infrastructure Strategy Discussion**:
   - **Local Development**: Evaluated Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration
   - **Production Strategy**: Discussed Terraform/OpenTofu for AWS infrastructure (ECS/Fargate for API, DynamoDB for persistence, S3/CloudFront for UI)
   - **Data Layer Consideration**: Identified need for repository abstraction to switch from MongoDB (local) to DynamoDB (production)
   - **Decision**: Manual orchestration for now since API/database are not mature enough for formal orchestration

### Architectural Planning Made
1. **Phased Approach Established**:
   - **Phase 2a**: Add `docker-compose.yml` for local development (future)
   - **Phase 2b**: Abstract data access layer with Repository pattern (future)  
   - **Phase 3**: Add Terraform/OpenTofu for AWS production infrastructure (future)

2. **Environment Strategy**:
   - **Local**: Docker containers with MongoDB for rapid development
   - **Production**: AWS managed services (ECS, DynamoDB, S3/CloudFront) for scalability
   - **Trade-off Accepted**: Local/production database differences outweighed by managed service benefits

### Current Project State
- **Architecture**: Full-stack with separate frontend/backend services ready for orchestration
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Node.js/Express API with MongoDB integration, health endpoints
- **Frontend**: React UI with Tiptap editor, contemplative design philosophy
- **Phase**: 1+ (Enhanced full-stack, ready for API integration priority)
- **Next Priority**: Backend API integration to replace localStorage with persistent MongoDB storage

### Files Modified This Session
- **Updated**: `CLAUDE.md` - Architecture section updated with backend services, Docker setup, repository structure, current status, and priorities reordered

### Infrastructure Strategy Documented
**Local Development Pattern**:
- Docker Compose for simplified multi-container orchestration
- Better service discovery and dependency management
- Single `docker-compose up` command for entire stack

**Production Pattern**: 
- Terraform/OpenTofu Infrastructure as Code
- AWS ECS/Fargate for containerized API service
- DynamoDB for managed persistence layer  
- S3/CloudFront for static UI hosting and CDN

**Implementation Timeline**:
- **Current**: Manual Docker orchestration (sufficient for development)
- **Future Phase 2**: Docker Compose + Repository abstraction
- **Future Phase 3**: Terraform + AWS production deployment

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Backend API Integration** (Critical Priority):
   - Implement Dreams CRUD endpoints with MongoDB persistence
   - Connect frontend DreamService to HTTP API calls
   - Replace localStorage with persistent database storage
   - Add proper error handling for network requests

2. **Complete Application Architecture**:
   - Full backend API integration testing
   - Dreams Dashboard implementation  
   - Mobile-responsive design completion

**Status**: Ready for backend API integration to complete the full-stack MERN architecture implementation.

## Session 2025-07-29 (Continued)

### Session Summary
**Objective**: Complete authentication system and Dream API vertical slice with full integration testing

**Major Accomplishments**:
1. **Two-Model Authentication Architecture**:
   - **IntroDreamer Model**: Lightweight pre-registration with email + dream content + contemplative scheduling
   - **Dreamer Model**: Full JWT authentication with Argon2id hashing and complete profile system
   - **UpgradeService**: Seamless migration from IntroDreamer → Dreamer preserving all dream data
   - **Clean Separation**: IntroDreamer has no knowledge of Dreamer model, upgrade handled by service layer

2. **Complete Authentication System**:
   - **JWT Access/Refresh Tokens**: 15min access + 7day refresh with httpOnly cookies
   - **Security Features**: Rate limiting, account lockout, token revocation, Argon2id password hashing
   - **Flexible Registration**: Either tempToken upgrade OR direct email registration
   - **Auth Middleware**: JWT verification for protected routes with automatic token refresh

3. **Dream API with Smart Conflict Resolution**:
   - **Dreamer-Scoped Data**: All Dreams owned by authenticated Dreamer
   - **ID Collision Handling**: Auto-generate new ID + return `newId` field for client sync
   - **Title Duplicate Handling**: Return existing dream data for easy client redirect
   - **Full CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete with proper ownership validation

4. **Integration Testing Infrastructure**:
   - **Comprehensive Test Script**: Covers all endpoints (auth + dreams) with curl commands
   - **Full User Flows**: IntroDreamer → Upgrade → Authentication → Dream CRUD → Cleanup
   - **Edge Case Testing**: Wrong passwords, unauthorized access, duplicate handling
   - **MongoDB Cleanup**: Automated queries for test data removal

### Technical Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Authentication Flow Priority**: 
   - **tempToken + email** → Upgrade path (IntroDreamer existing user)
   - **email only** → Direct registration (new user)
   - **Contemplative UX**: Default 2-day reminder if none specified

2. **Dream Ownership Model**:
   - Dreams belong to Dreamer._id (not IntroDreamer)
   - Slug uniqueness scoped per dreamer (not global)
   - Clean upgrade path preserves dream content and context

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - **ID Conflicts**: Generate new UUID + return for client update
   - **Title Conflicts**: Return existing dream for redirect UX
   - **Authentication Errors**: Clear messaging with appropriate HTTP codes

### Current Project State
- **Architecture**: Complete MERN stack with two-model authentication system
- **Backend**: Full authentication + Dream API with smart conflict resolution
- **Security**: Production-ready JWT system with comprehensive protection
- **Testing**: Integration test suite covering all endpoints and edge cases
- **Phase**: 2 (Complete backend vertical slice, ready for frontend integration)
